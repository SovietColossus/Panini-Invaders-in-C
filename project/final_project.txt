Project Name: Panini Invaders

Description of game concept and core functionality:

	Game concept: It's like space invaders, except with paninis
	and on the budget scale of an STM-32... pretty ritzy.

	Pretty much, this game is insane and you shoot paninis with your
	'S' (Ship, student, soul, spoon, servant...). You get points as
	you kill paninis or if you go into insane mode by holding c.
	It is possible to win... just really hard. Oh, and you get three
	lives because the paninis can shoot back at you as they move down.
	If they move all the way down or kill you with bullets, you lose...
	sorry? If you win though, you get the message we all aspire for.

	It's pretty functional... just make sure your nunchuk is plugged in
	and hope!
