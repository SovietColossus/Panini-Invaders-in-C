# Panini-Invaders-in-C
Final project for Computer Structures

So the point of this project was to mimic Space invaders. Unfortunately, I do not have the necessary picture files or sound files to work with this project. However, the code is there for constructive criticism. What started out as a joke became a reality: The point of the game is space invaders, while fighting panini's. When you're a space ship. All in good fun, ladies and gentlemen.

The drivers are written for the STM32 Cortex M3 board, and should provide all functions necessary for your own project, if you pursue such.

Needless to say, STM32 boards are extremely comfortable for a lot of projects.
